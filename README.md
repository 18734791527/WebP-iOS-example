WebP iOS Example
============================

A simple example of using [libwebp](http://code.google.com/speed/webp/) in iOS.

## REQUIREMENTS

Before you can compile the example application you will need to build the WebP framework for iOS. To do that run the build.sh file in the libwebp-build directory after downloading the latest libwebp archive. You can download the latest archive from the following URL: http://code.google.com/speed/webp/download.html

The framework build will produce a single framework that will work for the simulator, iPhone and iPad devices. To use it just add it to your project.

To use the demo project just open it with xcode and build.
